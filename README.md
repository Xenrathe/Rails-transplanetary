### Primary:

Transplanetary is a simple airport (spaceport, for flavoring) booking toy app, meant to demonstrate usage of complex forms, creating nested model entries, and Bootstrap CSS styling.

Transplanetary currently has no active webpage.

### Features:
* Flexible flight searching based on arrival and departure spaceports and day of flight
* Booking a flight also allows creation of individual Passenger model database entries
* Fully responsive views, across multiple breakpoints
* An impressive logo for TransPlanetary, if I do say so myself

### Development Notes
* Uses Stimulus to implement javascript
* Uses Bootstrap CSS

### Future to-do list
* NAVBAR -> stays fixed at top
* Flights index -> pagination
* Flights index -> scrollbar only on the flights itself, search form fixed at top
