## Transplanetary, a spaceport(airport) booking toy app

### Primary:

Transplanetary is a simple airport (spaceport, for flavoring) booking toy app, meant to demonstrate usage of complex forms and creating nested model entries.

Transplanetary currently has no active webpage.

### Features:
* Flexible flight searching based on arrival and departure spaceports and day of flight
* Booking a flight also allows creation of individual Passenger model database entries

### Future to-do list
* Spaceport index with grid of planet images, click -> info pops up
* Add passenger button for booking
* Add booking # to show
* Bookings index -> search for email + booking #

### Design Brief
This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum, specifically the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker">Flight Booker</a> project.
