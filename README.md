### Primary:

Transplanetary is a simple airport (spaceport, for flavoring) booking toy app, meant to demonstrate usage of complex forms and creating nested model entries.

Transplanetary currently has no active webpage.

### Features:
* Flexible flight searching based on arrival and departure spaceports and day of flight
* Booking a flight also allows creation of individual Passenger model database entries
